# Bruno's Vulkan Renderer (BVR)

This repo is just a place for me to try (yet again) to write a renderer directly on top of the Vulkan API.

## Why Vulkan?

There's lots of fully featured open source examples of Vulkan renderers. That's all.

## Plans

-[ ] Render a Triangle
-[ ] GLTF Loading
-[ ] Clustered Forward Rendering
-[ ] Image Based Lighting
-[ ] Shadow Mapping
-[ ] Temporal Anti-Aliasing
-[ ] Motion Blur
-[ ] Depth of Field
